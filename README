# Psychological Experiment

The psychological experiment is a n-back tast.
It consists of the occurence of one number (from 0 to 9)
And the subject has to judge if two consecutive numbers are even or odd. 
The subject has to press "E" if YES and "O" if NO. 


# Block Design 

The task is composed of two differents blocks:

A ==> The subject has to answer when two numbers are separated with another one 
  ==> example ==> 3-4-5 ==> 3 and 5 are both odd   ==> answer should be YES
  ==> example ==> 3-4-6 ==> 3 is odd and 6 is even ==> answer should be NO
  
B ==> The subject has to answer when two numbers are separated with two numbers 
  ==> example ==> 3-4-5-9 ==> 3 and 9 are both odd   ==> answer should be YES
  ==> example ==> 3-4-6-8 ==> 3 is odd and 8 is even ==> answer should be NO  
  
# Task Design 
  
The task is composed of 2x2 blocks:

A ==> B ==> A ==> B 

It is possible to change the position and numbers of blocks and the stimulus duration. 



 # Output
 
 The output consists of:
    - Type of blocks
    - Accuracy
    - Response-Time
    - Stimulus duration
